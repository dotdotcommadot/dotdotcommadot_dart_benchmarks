# dotdotcommadot dart benchmarks
###### Version: 0.0.1 -- alpha

## About
The main goal of this library is to compare different writing styles to each other.

i.e. What is faster? 
```"$hello $world"``` 
or 
```hello + " " + world``` ?

The point is to compare pieces of code rather than to compare Dart's VM against other VM's or runtimes.

This project is far from finished since it can grow infinitely.
Eventually, the point is that the right conclusions and performance tips 'n tricks will be taken of it.

## Running the Application
There are mainly three important ways of running the app:
- As Dart code, inside the Dart VM (Right Click 'Benchmark.dart' -- Click 'Run')
- As Dart code, inside Dartium (Right Click 'index.html' -- Click 'Run in Dartium')
- As JavaScript code, inside a Browser (Right Click 'index.html' -- Click 'Run as JavaScript')
